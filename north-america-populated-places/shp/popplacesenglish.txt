  Description:
    Abstract:
      A joint venture involving the National Atlas programs in Canada (Natural 
      Resources Canada), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática), and the United States (U.S. Geological Survey), as well as 
      the North American Commission for Environmental Co-operation, has led to 
      the release (June 2004) of several new products: an updated paper map of 
      North America, and its associated geospatial data sets and their metadata.  
      These data sets are available online from each of the partner countries 
      both for visualization and download.

      The North American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data sets at 
      1:10,000,000 scale.  A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads, 
      railroads, populated places, political boundaries, hydrography, 
      bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated so that their 
      relative positions are correct.  This collection of data sets forms a base 
      with which other North American thematic data may be integrated.  Any data 
      outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in 
      the North American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of 
      the data.

      The North American Atlas - Populated Places data set shows a selection of 
      named populated places suitable for use at a scale of 1:10,000,000.  Places, 
      which refer to individual municipalities, are always shown using point 
      symbols.  These symbols have been fitted to the North American Atlas roads, 
      railroads, and hydrography layers, so that the points represent the 
      approximate locations of places relative to data in these other layers.  
      The selection of populated places was based on local importance (as shown 
      by population size), importance as a cross-border point, and, occasionally, 
      on other factors.  All capital cities (national, provincial, territorial or 
      State) are shown for Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America.  
      Attributes were added to the data to reflect population class, name, and 
      capital.  Cartographic considerations were taken into account so that names 
      do not overlap in crowded areas, nor are there too many names shown for 
      sparsely-populated areas.  

    Purpose:
      The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and 
      analysis at the national and continental level.  These data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto 
      Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, or the U.S. Geological 
      Survey in the use of these data.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) is an international
      organization created by Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America 
      under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC).  
      The CEC was established to address regional environmental concerns, help 
      prevent potential trade and environmental conflicts, and to promote the 
      effective enforcement of environmental law.  The Agreement complements the
      environmental provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
      (NAFTA).  Further information on the CEC is available from 
      http://www.cec.org/ or from

      All North American Atlas data sets are available in four data formats: 
      Arc/INFO Export format (e00), ArcView Shapefile, Geography Markup Language 
      (GML) and Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS).

      Although these data are distributed in geographic coordinates, the North 
      American Atlas Map uses a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection.  The 
      following parameters were used for the map:
      >Longitude_of_Projection_Center: -100.00 
      >Latitude_of_Projection_Center: 45.00 
      >False_Easting (metres): 0.0 
      >False_Northing (metres): 0.0 
      >Semi-major_Axis: 6370997.0 
      >Denominator_of_Flattening_Ratio: 1.0
      >Ellipsoid_Name: Sphere 
      >Units: metres

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: 
      Where possible, attribute data were quality controlled by creating 
      symbolized digital displays or hard copy plots, which were visually 
      verified with digital or hard copy reference data.  Attribute data that 
      could not be verified in such a manner were interactively queried to check 
      for anomalies such as duplication of data in fields requiring unique 
      values and incorrect feature coding.  Data for areas outside of Canada, 
      Mexico, and the United States of America are only provided for context;
      Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey assume no responsibility 
      for the completeness, accuracy, or presentation of this data.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: 
    Logical consistency of the data was ensured by using the same selection 
    criteria for all three countries.  
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set includes populated places for all of North America as shown at 
    1:10,000,000 scale.  The data completeness reflects the content of the 
    source data, the integration done by the cartographers, and the quality 
    control of the content performed by each country.
  Positional_Accuracy: 
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy: 
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
        Positional accuracy of the data is unknown.  Positions are dependent on 
        the positioning of the data in the integration processes.  Data for 
        areas outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America are 
        only provided for context; Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional 
        de Estadística Geografía e Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey 
        assume no responsibility for the completeness, accuracy, or presentation 
        of this data.

  Description:
    Abstract: 
      This map layer is an Arc/INFO grid map of North America, excluding Hawaii 
      and including the Caribbean and most of Mexico, that portrays at 1 sq. 
      km resolution an index of land cover diversity calculated at 729 sq. km.
      scale.  The map layer was created by applying a spatial filter to a 
      published map of seasonal land cover regions (Loveland et al. 1991) 
      known as NASLCR1_2L which was obtained from the USGS EROS Data Center 
      Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).  The spatial filter computed
      Simpson's (1949) index of land cover diversity within 729 sq. km. (27 x 
      27 pixels) windows from the proportions of different land cover types 
      within a window.  The [0,1] continuous index was discretized, and a byte 
      representation (range: [1,245], with zero reserved for missing values) 
      of the index value was stored at the center location in each window. 
      The resulting surface map was projected to a standard projection, and 
      clipped to shorelines defined by the STATP075 shoreline map (USGS).
      The data available through the National Atlas of the United States are
      in GeoTIFF format.  This is a revised version of the May 2002 map layer, 
      with a corrected shoreline for Greenland.

    Purpose: 
      These data were originally created as part of a global analysis of land 
      cover diversity and pattern based on digital land cover maps derived 
      from remote sensing (AVHRR) and produced by the Global Land Cover 
      Characteristics project.  The land cover diversity map portrays relative 
      diversity, considering both natural and anthropogenic land cover types, 
      as a first step towards quantifying biodiversity at landscape-scale 
      levels of biological organization.  No responsibility is assumed by the 
      U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.
    Supplemental_Information: 
      In the online, interactive National Atlas of the United States, these 
      data are grouped into 6 classes for display purposes.  The display image 
      was created by using the Arc/INFO GRID command SLICE.  The resultant 
      grid was converted into a TIFF file for display purposes only.  The 
      following lookup table describes the diversity classes in the display 
      TIFF image:

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: 
      The Simpson index is based on the proportions of different land cover 
      types within a defined analysis window.  A statistical rule of thumb is 
      that 50 observations are needed to accurately estimate a proportion.  
      The analysis window was 27x27 pixels in size, or 729 pixels total, which 
      exceeds the rule of thumb value of 50 needed to estimate a proportion.
      Simpson's index is just one of many which could have been used to 
      quantify 'diversity'; for a discussion of the relative strengths and 
      weaknesses of various indices, please consult a standard textbook on 
      quantitative ecology.  In comparison to other diversity indices, 
      Simpson's index tends to be more sensitive to changes in abundant land
      cover types and less sensitive to changes in rare cover types, and 
      therefore less sensitive to isolated label errors (mis-classification) 
      on the land cover map.  Like other indices, Simpson's index is best 
      interpreted as a relative value, in comparison to other pixels on the 
      same map.  Comparisons with other maps prepared from different data 
      sources or at different scale are tenuous.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: 
    All cell values are in the range [0,255].  Zero represents ocean or other 
    water, and 255 represents unlabeled land area.
  Completeness_Report: 
    Every cell identified as land surface in the original land cover map has a 
    non-zero value representing the land cover diversity index.  Some coastal 
    regions may have missing values as a result of reprojecting the diversity
    map to a standard projection and clipping to a mask.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
        The positional accuracy of the land cover diversity map is the same as
        the positional accuracy of the land cover map from which the diversity 
        map was derived.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:  
        Derivation of land cover diversity from land cover:

        Land cover data (NA_SLCR) was obtained from EROS Data Center in band 
        sequential (bsq) format.  The header was created using metadata for 
        NA_SLCR, and brought into Arc/INFO using the IMAGEGRID command.

        The land cover data was exported to ASCII format using the Arc/INFO 
        command GRIDASCII, and the format was converted to an in-house format 
        using an in-house software tool named ASC2TVA.C.

        The map was subdivided into four (4) overlapping rectangles using an 
        in-house software tool named SPLITTER.C.  The rectangles overlapped to 
        avoid artifacts near image boundaries during the spatial filtering
        operations.

        The in-house spatial filtering program SPATCONV.C was used to process 
        each of the four rectangles, to estimate Simpson's diversity index 
        (described in Nature1949), as follows:  A 729 sq. km. (27x27 pixels) 
        quadrat was centered on each pixel of the original land cover map. 
        Simpson's index was then calculated as one minus the sum of the 
        squares of the land cover proportions within the quadrat.  The index 
        ranges from zero to one, with larger index values representing greater 
        land cover diversity.  The calculated values were discretized to the 
        range [1,255] and stored at one-kilometer spatial resolution.  Thus, a 
        pixel value in this data represents the land cover diversity of the 
        surrounding 729 sq. km. on the original land cover map.  Pixels 
        representing water were included in the diversity calculations if the 
        pixel at the center of the quadrat was not water, but no calculation 
        was made if the quadrat was centered on a water pixel.

        The transformation used to discretize the index values was:
          >D = ( C * 254) + 1
          >where
          >D = discretized value in range [1,255]
          >C = calculated value of Simpson's index in range [0,1]

        If needed, the original calculated values can be approximated by 
        applying the back-transformation:
          >C = (D - 1) / 254

        Note that the back-transformed values will be in steps of
        approximately 0.00394 as a result of the discretization process 
        (precision has been lost).

        After spatial filtering, the map of diversity index values was 
        constructed by: reassembling the four rectangles into a single image 
        via an in-house software tool named LUMPER.C, which removed the 
        overlapping parts of the rectangles; converting the format to ASCII 
        using the in-house software tool TVA2ASC.C; and finally, bringing the 
        file back into Arc/INFO using the command ASCIIGRID.

        The georeferencing did not change as a result of reformatting, 
        exporting, and importing, or spatial filtering.  The derived map is 
        comparable on a pixel-by-pixel basis to the original land cover map.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The derived diversity map (SLDIV27_A) was projected to the Lambert 
        Azimuthal Equal Area projection, using the Arc/INFO command PROJECT.  
        This projection is the standard projection used for image files in the 
        National Atlas of the United States.  The only difference between
        the original diversity map projection and the National Atlas 
        projection is the latitude of the projection center, which is 50 
        degrees 0' 0" in the original map, compared to 45 degrees 0' 0" in the 
        National Atlas.  The new projection resulted in a slightly larger cell 
        size (1001.042 meters square) in comparison to the original land cover 
        and diversity maps (1000 meters square).

        The image was clipped to the study area using the shoreline file, and 
        the land areas without data were added.  This was accomplished by 
        defining a grid mask using Arc/INFO's command POLYGRID and specifying 
        a cell size of 1000.984 meters.  The clip was done in Arc/INFO GRID by 
        setting the mask and analysis window (SETMASK and SETWINDOW) to the 
        gridded version of STATP075, and overlaying.

        The resulting map was visually inspected, then exported using the 
        Arc/INFO command EXPORT with the options set to 'grid, no 
        compression'.  The standard UNIX compress utility was applied to the 
        exported file.

        The grid was converted to a TIFF image using the command GRIDIMAGE. 
        Two files were created during the conversion, the TIFF image and a 
        world file (.tfw extension) containing real-world coordinate 
        transformation information.

      Process_Description:
        Image data for Greenland were adjusted and remasked to correct for 
        geometric distortion in the northwest part of the island between the 
        Robeson Channel and Cape Morris Jesup, and to improve registration with 
        a new, corrected coastline derived from World Vector Shoreline (WVS). 

        A link coverage was created in ArcEdit containing links between the 
        original Greenland data and the new coastline.  The link coverage was 
        used in the Arc Adjust command to perform a linear transformation with 
        nearest neighbor resampling on the original image, stored as an Arc/INFO 
        grid dataset.  The resulting image is geometrically correct and fits the 
        WVS coastline.  This correction was applied to data for Greenland only; 
        the rest of the image was left unchanged.

    Entity_Type:
      Entity_Type_Label: Land cover diversity grid cell
      Entity_Type_Definition: 
        Any of the data elements in the land cover diversity file.
      Entity_Type_Definition_Source: U.S. Geological Survey
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: Land cover diversity grid cell value
      Attribute_Definition: 
        The value is a measure of the variety (diversity) of land cover 
        classes in the area surrounding the grid cell.  Diversity is described 
        by a range of values, where smaller values represent less diversity,
        and larger values represent more diversity.

  Description:
    Abstract:
      The Bathymetric Shaded Relief of North America map layer shows depth 
      ranges using colors, with relief enhanced by shading.  The image was 
      derived from the National Geophysical Data Center’s ETOPO2 elevation data, 
      which is an elevation database gridded at 2-minute resolution, containing 
      elevation and bathymetry for the world.  The image was produced from the 
      October 2001 data set.  
    Purpose:
      The bathymetric shaded relief image was developed to portray the 
      underwater terrain of North America.  The image is intended for visual 
      purposes only.  The original ETOPO2 data must be used for conducting 
      analysis and determining specific bathymetric values.
    Supplemental_Information:
       This image contains color shaded relief in RGB color space.  For access 
       to the original 2-byte data, please visit the National Geophysical Data 
       Center web site mentioned below.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 
        The ETOPO2 data set was downloaded from the National Geophysical Data 
        Center web site using their GEODAS Grid Translator Design–a-Grid 
        interface.  This interface allows a user to create custom grids.  Users 
        can access the web interface at 
        <http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/gdas/gd_designagrid.html>. The following 
        grid parameters were used:
        >Grid Database:                   ETOPO2 2-minute Global Relief
        >Latitude/Longitude Area Bounds:  90°0'N to 90°0'S, 180°0'W to 180°0'E
        >Grid Cell Size:                  2 minutes
        >Grid Cell Value Parameters:      2-byte integers, whole meters
        >Grid Format:                     ASCII raster format, Arc header 

        The downloaded grid was converted to an Arc/INFO grid using the 
        ArcToolbox import-to-raster interface.  ArcToolbox was also used to 
        define the initial coordinate system as Geographic (Lat/Lon) with units 
        in decimal degrees, and the datum as WGS 1984.  East and west grids were 
        derived from the main grid using the Arc/INFO command GRIDCLIP.  The 
        east grid coverage was from 150 degrees to 180 degrees longitude and 
        0 degrees to 90 degrees latitude.  The west grid coverage was from 0 
        degrees to -180 degrees longitude and 0 degrees to 90 degrees latitude.  
        The Arc/INFO command GRIDSHIFT was used to shift each grid 40 degrees 
        east, moving all data into the Western hemisphere.  This data processing 
        step was necessary due to the inability of Arc/INFO to project raster 
        data across the 180-degree longitude line.  The Arc/INFO Grid command 
        MERGE was used to combine the two grids into one grid.  This grid was 
        projected into the Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection, centered on 
        100 degrees West, 45 degrees North.  The .prj file used in the Arc 
        PROJECT command contained these parameters:
        > INPUT
        > PROJECTION GEOGRAPHIC
        > UNITS DD
        > PARAMETERS
        > OUTPUT
        > PROJECTION LAMBERT_AZIMUTHAL
        > UNITS METERS
        > XSHIFT 0.0
        > YSHIFT 0.0
        > PARAMETERS
        > 0.0
        > -60 0 0
        > 45 0 0
        > 0.0
        > 0.0
        > END
        >
        Using a center of longitude of 60 degrees West in the projection 
        parameters creates an actual center of 100 degrees West due to the grid 
        shift of 40 degrees.  After projecting the data, the Arc/INFO command 
        PROJECTDEFINE was used to reset the central meridian to 100 degrees 
        West.  The Arc/INFO command GRIDCLIP was used to clip the grid to match 
        the dimensions used for National Atlas of the United States data.

        The bathymetric color shaded relief image was created by combining two 
        files.  The first was a color image created by converting the depths 
        from meters to feet, classifying the data into depth ranges, and then 
        assigning an RGB color to each range, as shown below.
        >Depth Range         Index  Red    Green   Blue
        >From      To
        >-28300    -16000      1    53     146     214
        >-15999    -12000      2    87     159     220
        >-11999    -9000       3    124    180     231
        >-8999     -6000       4    146    194     237
        >-5999     -3000       5    170    212     243
        >-2999     -1500       6    186    219     247
        >-1499     -750        7    200    228     251
        >-749      20320       8    216    236     252
        The lightest color tint (index 8) extended across the land area.  The 
        file was converted to TIFF format using the command GRIDIMAGE.  Adobe 
        Photoshop was used to convert this image from RGB to CMY (no black).

        The second file was a grayscale shaded relief rendition of the elevation 
        data created with the Arc/INFO Grid command HILLSHADE.  The data were 
        first filtered using a smoothing filter to lessen noise in the data.  
        The HILLSHADE command was then performed using the following parameters:
        >azimuth = 315 degrees
        >altitude  = 45 degrees
        >shade type = SHADE
        >vertical exaggeration = 5.0
        The file was added as a black (K) band to the first file (CMY), to 
        create a CMYK color shaded relief image.  Overall contrast was enhanced 
        and then, in Adobe Photoshop, the CMYK image was converted to RGB.

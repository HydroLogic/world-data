  Description:
    Abstract:
      A joint venture involving the National Atlas programs in Canada (Natural 
      Resources Canada), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática), and the United States (U.S. Geological Survey), as well as 
      the North American Commission for Environmental Co-operation, has led to 
      the release (June 2004) of several new products: an updated paper map of 
      North America, and its associated geospatial data sets and their metadata.  
      These data sets are available online from each of the partner countries 
      both for visualization and download.

      The North American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data sets at 
      1:10,000,000 scale.  A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads, 
      railroads, populated places, political boundaries, hydrography, 
      bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated so that their 
      relative positions are correct.  This collection of data sets forms a base 
      with which other North American thematic data may be integrated.  Any data 
      outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in 
      the North American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of 
      the data.

      The North American Atlas - Glaciers data set shows areas of permanent ice 
      found on the North America landmass including Greenland, and also shows 
      areas of land found within glaciers.  No distinction is made between major 
      glaciers, ice fields, and the Greenland ice cap.  The only permanent ice 
      shown on land areas outside of North America and Greenland is on Iceland.

    Purpose:
      The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and 
      analysis at the national and continental level.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto 
      Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, or the U.S. Geological 
      Survey in the use of these data. 
    Supplemental_Information:
      The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) is an international
      organization created by Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America 
      under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC).  
      The CEC was established to address regional environmental concerns, help 
      prevent potential trade and environmental conflicts, and to promote the 
      effective enforcement of environmental law.  The Agreement complements the
      environmental provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
      (NAFTA).  Further information on the CEC is available from 
      http://www.cec.org/ or from

      All North American Atlas data sets are available in four data formats: 
      Arc/INFO Export format (e00), ArcView Shapefile, Geography Markup Language 
      (GML) and Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS).

      Although these data are distributed in geographic coordinates, the North 
      American Atlas Map uses a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection.  The 
      following parameters were used for the map:
      >Longitude_of_Projection_Center: -100.00 
      >Latitude_of_Projection_Center: 45.00 
      >False_Easting (metres): 0.0 
      >False_Northing (metres): 0.0 
      >Semi-major_Axis: 6370997.0 
      >Denominator_of_Flattening_Ratio: 1.0

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: 
      Where possible, attribute data were quality controlled by creating 
      symbolized digital displays or hard copy plots, which were visually 
      verified with digital or hard copy reference data.  Attribute data that 
      could not be verified in such a manner were interactively queried to check 
      for anomalies such as duplication of data in fields requiring unique 
      values and incorrect feature coding.  Data for areas outside of Canada, 
      Mexico, and the United States of America are only provided for context;
      Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey assume no responsibility 
      for the completeness, accuracy, or presentation of this data.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: 
    Topology was built and a quality control of the glaciers polygon data was 
    done in order to ensure topological polygon structure.  
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set includes glaciers for all of North as shown at 1:10,000,000 
    scale.  The data completeness reflects the content of the source data, the 
    integration done by the cartographers, and the quality control of the 
    content performed by each country.
  Positional_Accuracy: 
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy: 
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
        Positional accuracy of the data is unknown. Positions are dependent on 
        the accuracy of the source data and on the result of the generalization 
        and integration processes.  Data for areas outside of Canada, Mexico, 
        and the United States of America are only provided for context; Natural 
        Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
        Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey assume no responsibility for 
        the completeness, accuracy, or presentation of this data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Linework from the 1:7,500,000 Atlas of Canada Glaciers map was projected 
        and fitted to the 1:10,000,000 North America Atlas, Hydrography.  
        Cartographers at The Atlas of Canada did the integration and 
        generalization of the data, maintaining a cartographic representation 
        suitable for 1:10,000,000 scale.  The attribute for the country was 
        added to the data.  Polygon topology was created so the glaciers could 
        be shown as polygons and an area fill could be used for cartographic 
        representation.  Quality control of the cartographic representation was 
        performed by each country.  The attributes were also verified.

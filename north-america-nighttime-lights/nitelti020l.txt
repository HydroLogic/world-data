  Description
    Abstract:
      This map layer is an image of nighttime lights for North America,
      including the Caribbean and most of Mexico.  The data were collected in
      1996 and 1997 as part of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
      (DMSP).  The data available through the National Atlas of the United 
      States are in GeoTIFF format.  This is a revised version of the May 2002 
      map layer, with a corrected shoreline for Greenland.

    Purpose: 
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in 
      the use of these data.

    Supplemental_Information:
      The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites collect
      visible and infrared cloud imagery as well as monitoring the
      atmospheric, oceanographic, hydrologic, cryospheric and near-Earth
      space environments.  The DMSP program maintains a constellation of two,
      sun-synchronous, near-polar orbiting satellites.  The orbital period is
      101 minutes and inclination is 99 degrees.  The atmospheric and
      oceanographic sensors record radiances at visible, infrared and
      microwave wavelengths.  The solar-geophysical sensors measure
      ionospheric plasma fluxes, densities, temperatures and velocities.

      The OLS (Operational Linescan System) visible band (0.4-1.1 micrometers)
      is used to locate recurring nighttime lights.  The thermal OLS band
      (10.5-12.5 micrometers) is used to screen for cloud free orbits.  During
      the periods 16-21 March, 1996, 5-14 January, 1997, and 3-12 February,
      1997, the gain on the OLS sensor was turned down to 24 from the normal
      64 decibels.  The result was an image in which urban centers do not
      saturate the signal. 

      DMSP visible and infrared imagery of clouds covers a 3,000 km swath,
      thus each satellite provides global coverage of both daytime and
      nighttime conditions each day.  The field view of the microwave imagers
      and sounders is only 1,500 km, thus approximately 3 days data are
      required for one instrument to provide global coverage at equatorial
      latitudes.  The solar-geophysical instruments make in-situ measurements
      of ionospheric parameters, some of which vary very rapidly.

      This program is a joint effort with extensive collaboration between the
      Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Office, Air Force Global

 
      Weather Central, the Strategic Environmental Research and Development

      Program, the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological
      Services and Supporting Research, and the National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration.

      Process_Description:
        During the periods from 16-21 March, 1996, 5-14 January, 1997, and 3-
        12 February, 1997, the gain on the OLS sensor was turned down to 24
        from the normal 64 decibels.  The result was an image in which urban
        centers do not saturate the signal.  The National Geophysical Data
        Center (NGDC) received the complete DMSP data stream in the same form
        in which it was received at Air Force Weather Agency.  NGDC processed 
        the map layer to restore data lost during transmission and compute 
        satellite positions.

        In addition, very near infrared (VNIR) emission sources and clouds for
        each of the suborbits were detected and geolocated, and the data were
        composited.  Image time series analysis was used to distinguish lights
        produced by cities, towns, and industrial facilities from sensor noise
        and ephemeral lights arising from fires and lightning.  The time
        series approach was required to ensure that each land area was covered
        with sufficient cloud free observations to determine the presence or
        absence of VNIR emission sources.

        The worldwide nighttime lights data file (DMSPOLS) was received in
        TIFF format.  The file was converted to JPEG format and resampled in
        Adobe Photoshop to reduce the file size.  The file was then converted
        to ESRI GRID format, the image was truncated using the shoreline mask
        (shorelp020l), and the value of the water areas was set to 255.  The
        file was converted back to TIFF format.

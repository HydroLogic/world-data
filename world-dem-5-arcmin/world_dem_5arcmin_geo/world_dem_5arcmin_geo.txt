# Preliminary documentation for world_dem_5arcmin_geo

This data set containes spot elevations, in meters, on a 5 arcminute
grid covering the entire world.

16-bit signed integers are used for both land elevations and bathymetric
values.

The data set starts at 0 degrees longitude and 90 degrees north
latitude.  There appears to be a partial bad line at 81 deg 15 min S,
extending from 0 to 40 deg E, which has very much lower values than the
lines immediately above or below; the bad pixels are not of constant
value, but instead appear to increase slowly from west to east.

The .bsq file contains a 4320 by 2160 rectangular array, with each row
starting at 0 degress longitude and going eastwards around the earth,
and with the first row starting at 90 degrees north latitude.

The .img, .ddr, and .his files are standard LAS format; the .lan file is
ERDAS
